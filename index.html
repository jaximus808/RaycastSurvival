                    <p>To move use the key combination WASD, W - Forward, A - Left, S - Back, D - Right. Use the "Shift" key to sprint which increases your speed with no downsides yet. The "number 1" key is to pause and unpause the game. To move the camera use the mouse or the left and right arrow keys. To shoot use the left mouse button or click space. Use the "e" key to interact with objects such as the upgrade center. </p>

                    <p>The goal of the game is too simply kill the most bad guys (the black squares) you can and to get powerups to make the expeierence easier using the points as currency. Score is also determined by how short the wave lasts incentivising the player to not take so long.</p>

                    <p>The enemies AI is designed as if they see you, get hit by you, or they hear you shoot a gun within a radius then they will begin to chase you. Chasing stops once they lose sight of you. While the enemies do not see you they wander randomly and change direction whenever they hit a wall </p>

                    <p>The minimap in the top left can help you visually the game area so you don't get lost. It's a great tool for enemies sneaking up on you. The player is a blue circle and the enemies are black squares. The lines that extrude out of the shapes are the directions they are facing. Use this to check if an enemy can see you or not.</p>
