                    <p>Use the key combination WASD to move, W - Forward, A - Left, S - Back, D - Right. The "Shift" key allows player to boost speed with no drawbacks. The game can be paused and resumed with the "number 1" key. Move the camera with the mouse or the left/right arrow keys. To shoot, hold down the left mouse or press the space bar. To interact with objects, press the "e" key. </p>
                    <span></span>   
                    <p>The objective of the game is to kill as many evil guys (black squares) as possible while collecting powerups to add on to the experience. The length of the wave also affects the score, incentivizing the player to not take too long.</p>

                <div id="description">
                    <p>The opponent spawns in the map's tan region. If the opponent notices you within a certain radius, they will start chasing you. When they lose sight of you, the chasing stops. While the enemy are unaware of your presence, they roam aimlessly and shift direction whenever they come upon a wall.</p>
                    <span></span>   
                    <p>The top-left minimap can help in visualizing the game zone so you don't get lost. It’s also a helpful weapon for sneaking up on the enemy. Enemies are represented by black squares, and the player is a blue circle. The lines that extrude out of the shapes are the directions they are facing. Use this to check if an enemy can see you or not.</p> 
                    <span></span>   
                    <p>The upgrade center is shown as a green square. When in range of use; it turns yellow, push the “e” key to discover the upgrade center. Upgrades can be purchased here with points, in order to enhance game experience. During this time, the game will automatically pause, so make sure to manage your points wisely!"</p>
